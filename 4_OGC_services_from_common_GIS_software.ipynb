    "QGIS allows you to set up a \"GeoNode\" connection with the iAtlantic GeoNode, from which you access images through WMS, vector data through WFS and raster data through WCS. Alternatively, you can create separate WMS, WFS and WCS connections to `https://www.geonode.iatlantic.eu/geoserver/ows`, however, the GeoNode connection automatically provides connections to all of the remote services that have been coupled to the GeoNode. Below we give a walkthrough of how you can set up an iAtlantic GeoNode connections from within QGIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1) Right click the GeoNode connection in the browser (open via `View`>`Panels`>`Browse`) and select `New Connection`\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"./img/QGIS_1.jpg\" align=\"center\" width=\"30%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2) Add a name and the iAtlantic GeoNode URL `https://www.geonode.iatlantic.eu`, then click ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"./img/QGIS_2.jpg\" align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3) From the GeoNode connection, you can browse through:\n",
    "> * the raster data available for download on the iAtlantic GeoNode in the WCS folder\n",
    "> * the vector data available for download on the iAtlantic GeoNode under the WFS folder\n",
    "> * data visualisation of (raster & vector) datasets available on both the iAtlantic GeoNode and external remote services linked to the GeoNode (e.g. EMODnet, CMEMS, Ifremer, PANGAEA) \n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"./img/QGIS_3.jpg\" align=\"center\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4) You can add WMS map images, WFS vector data and WCS raster data by simply double-clicking on them. Below is an example map created by combining an image of the Alcyoniina Habitat Suitability on the iAtlantic GeoNode WMS, an image of the telecommunication cables from EMODnet Human activities WMS and a dataset of the world ocean seamounts downloaded from the iAtlantic GeoNode WFS.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Limitation**: By default you will only have access to the publicly available layers on the GeoNode. In order to access restricted layers (to which your GeoNode account has access to on the web platform), you will have to set up OAuth authentication on your QGIS application.
